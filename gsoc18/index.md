Google Summer of Code 2018: contributing to Honeytrap
====

This article is a summary of my contribution to [Honeytrap](https://github.com/honeytrap/honeytrap) in the context of [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/dashboard/) 2018, as required by Google.

## In a nutshell

I achieved the proposed project, "Implementing Yara rules in Honeytrap" (code: [1](https://github.com/honeytrap/honeytrap/pull/326), [2](https://github.com/CapacitorSet/elasticsearch-yara), [3](https://github.com/honeytrap/honeytrap-web/pull/6)). I also implemented several features both in the scope of my project and outside of it, for example [transforms](https://github.com/honeytrap/honeytrap/pull/284), [Redis](https://github.com/honeytrap/honeytrap/pull/202)/[memcached](https://github.com/honeytrap/honeytrap/pull/208)/[adb](https://github.com/honeytrap/honeytrap/pull/385) honeypots, [ports-based config](https://github.com/honeytrap/honeytrap/pull/224).

## In-scope contributions

My proposal was about implementing [Yara](https://github.com/VirusTotal/yara) rules in the [Honeytrap](https://github.com/honeytrap/honeytrap) honeypot. Yara is a pattern-matching language, commonly used to classify malware samples in a language- and platform-agnostic way; I figured it'd be interesting to apply it to events produced by a honeypot.

The text of my proposal follows (amended for conciseness).

>Yara is very extensible, and could be conveniently used to describe malicious actors interacting with a honeypot. Specifically, with the pattern-matching weâ€™ll be able to identify specific attacks and link them to specific botnets or exploits.
>
>The final goal of my application is to fully integrate Yara in Honeytrap spanning several contexts, a work which directly translates to a logical timeline:
>
> * *Yara filter*: Honeytrap implements *filters*, which are components that select data from a channel and pipe it into another. A Yara-based filter enables the user to write smart filters that group interactions logically: an example application would be a malware researcher storing all Mirai connection attempts into ElasticSearch for later analysis, or a company logging Nmap-based connections to a canary to be alerted of internal network scans. Such filters would allow for both stateless matching (operating on single events, independently of the others) and more complex stateful matching.
> * *Yara search*: users may also be interested in analyzing interactions at a later time. As such, there may be interest in searching logs using Yara rules. This section would implement Yara searching in ElasticSearch, the Honeytrap backend of choice, through server-side scripting.
> * *Yara reporting*: Honeytrap implements a Web-based dashboard. Integrating Yara into the dashboard is a key step in making this contribution easy to use.
> * *Yara definitions*: once the pattern-matching infrastructure is in place, I plan to create Yara definitions for common threats and other items of interest: among them, specific CVEs (eg. CVE-2017-0144 aka EternalBlue), botnets (Mirai network), tools (sqlmap, nmap).

### Yara filter

I eventually found that filters were too simple for the project requirements, so I refactored them into *transforms*, a stateful component which receives single events and can send zero, one or more events (in this sense, it is similar to a flat map).

I proceeded to implement a transform for Yara matching in the form of a filter (you pass a Yara file in the config, it filters all events that match at least one rule); however, I found that there are many situations in which a filter is not sufficient (eg. detecting an event from ruleset A, followed by an event from ruleset B), so I made a generic Yara "library" which can be reused in custom complex transforms.

As a result of this development, I also [contributed](#northern-lightsyara-parser) to an external project, a Yara parser.

>PRs: [#284](https://github.com/honeytrap/honeytrap/pull/284), [#326](https://github.com/honeytrap/honeytrap/pull/326)

### Yara search

I developed an ElasticSearch plugin for searching events that match a Yara ruleset.

As a personal note, the development of this feature was by far the most excruciating, due to the sheer complexity of Java development and the lack of developer documentation for ElasticSearch.

### Yara reporting

I added a Yara panel to the Web UI.

## Contributions to external projects

### [Northern-Lights/yara-parser](https://github.com/Northern-Lights/yara-parser)

I found out that to apply Yara rules I had to first define variables, which led to the use of a parser to extract variables from the rule source. To do that, I [extended](https://github.com/honeytrap/honeytrap-web/pull/6) an existing parser in Go, `Northern-Lights/yara-parser`.

### [Yara](https://github.com/VirusTotal/yara)

Bug reports: unexpected behaviour when...

 * [defining the same variable twice](https://github.com/VirusTotal/yara/issues/908)
 * [defining a variable with the same name as a rule](https://github.com/VirusTotal/yara/issues/920)
