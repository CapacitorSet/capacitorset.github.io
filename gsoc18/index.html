<h1 id="google-summer-of-code-2018-contributing-to-honeytrap">Google Summer of Code 2018: contributing to Honeytrap</h1>
<p>This article is a summary of my contribution to <a href="https://github.com/honeytrap/honeytrap">Honeytrap</a> in the context of <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/dashboard/">Google Summer of Code</a> 2018, as required by Google.</p>
<h2 id="in-a-nutshell">In a nutshell</h2>
<p>I achieved the proposed project, “Implementing Yara rules in Honeytrap” (code: <a href="https://github.com/honeytrap/honeytrap/pull/326">1</a>, <a href="https://github.com/CapacitorSet/elasticsearch-yara">2</a>, <a href="https://github.com/honeytrap/honeytrap-web/pull/6">3</a>). I also implemented several features both in the scope of my project and outside of it, for example <a href="https://github.com/honeytrap/honeytrap/pull/284">transforms</a>, <a href="https://github.com/honeytrap/honeytrap/pull/202">Redis</a>/<a href="https://github.com/honeytrap/honeytrap/pull/208">memcached</a>/<a href="https://github.com/honeytrap/honeytrap/pull/385">adb</a> honeypots, <a href="https://github.com/honeytrap/honeytrap/pull/224">ports-based config</a>.</p>
<h2 id="in-scope-contributions">In-scope contributions</h2>
<p>My proposal was about implementing <a href="https://github.com/VirusTotal/yara">Yara</a> rules in the <a href="https://github.com/honeytrap/honeytrap">Honeytrap</a> honeypot. Yara is a pattern-matching language, commonly used to classify malware samples in a language- and platform-agnostic way; I figured it’d be interesting to apply it to events produced by a honeypot.</p>
<p>The text of my proposal follows (amended for conciseness).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yara is very extensible, and could be conveniently used to describe malicious actors interacting with a honeypot. Specifically, with the pattern-matching we’ll be able to identify specific attacks and link them to specific botnets or exploits.</p>
<p>The final goal of my application is to fully integrate Yara in Honeytrap spanning several contexts, a work which directly translates to a logical timeline:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Yara filter</em>: Honeytrap implements <em>filters</em>, which are components that select data from a channel and pipe it into another. A Yara-based filter enables the user to write smart filters that group interactions logically: an example application would be a malware researcher storing all Mirai connection attempts into ElasticSearch for later analysis, or a company logging Nmap-based connections to a canary to be alerted of internal network scans. Such filters would allow for both stateless matching (operating on single events, independently of the others) and more complex stateful matching.</li>
<li><em>Yara search</em>: users may also be interested in analyzing interactions at a later time. As such, there may be interest in searching logs using Yara rules. This section would implement Yara searching in ElasticSearch, the Honeytrap backend of choice, through server-side scripting.</li>
<li><em>Yara reporting</em>: Honeytrap implements a Web-based dashboard. Integrating Yara into the dashboard is a key step in making this contribution easy to use.</li>
<li><em>Yara definitions</em>: once the pattern-matching infrastructure is in place, I plan to create Yara definitions for common threats and other items of interest: among them, specific CVEs (eg. CVE-2017-0144 aka EternalBlue), botnets (Mirai network), tools (sqlmap, nmap).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="yara-filter">Yara filter</h3>
<p>I eventually found that filters were too simple for the project requirements, so I refactored them into <em>transforms</em>, a stateful component which receives single events and can send zero, one or more events (in this sense, it is similar to a flat map).</p>
<p>I proceeded to implement a transform for Yara matching in the form of a filter (you pass a Yara file in the config, it filters all events that match at least one rule); however, I found that there are many situations in which a filter is not sufficient (eg. detecting an event from ruleset A, followed by an event from ruleset B), so I made a generic Yara “library” which can be reused in custom complex transforms.</p>
<p>As a result of this development, I also <a href="#northern-lightsyara-parser">contributed</a> to an external project, a Yara parser.</p>

</blockquote>
<h3 id="yara-search">Yara search</h3>
<p>I developed an ElasticSearch plugin for searching events that match a Yara ruleset.</p>
<p>As a personal note, the development of this feature was by far the most excruciating, due to the sheer complexity of Java development and the lack of developer documentation for ElasticSearch.</p>

<p>I found out that to apply Yara rules I had to first define variables, which led to the use of a parser to extract variables from the rule source. To do that, I <a href="https://github.com/honeytrap/honeytrap-web/pull/6">extended</a> an existing parser in Go, <code>Northern-Lights/yara-parser</code>.</p>
